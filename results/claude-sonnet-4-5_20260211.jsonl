The car itself is what needs to be there.\n\n2. **What happens at inspection**: The inspection center needs to examine your vehicle, so the car must be physically present at their location.\n\n3. **How to get the car there**: \n   - If you walk, your car stays where it is (doesn't accomplish the goal)\n   - If you drive, your car arrives at the inspection center (accomplishes the goal)\n\n4. **Distance consideration**: While \"across the street\" is very close, that doesn't change the fact that the car needs to be moved there.\n\n**Answer: Drive**\n\nYou need to drive your car to the inspection center because the whole point is to bring the vehicle there for inspection.
