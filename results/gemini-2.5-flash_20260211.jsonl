The oil will still be thick and cold.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n*   **Drive your car for 10-15 minutes before heading to the shop.** This will get the engine and oil up to operating temperature. It doesn't have to be a long, fast drive – just enough to warm things up.\n*   **Then, drive the 100 meters to the shop.**\n\n**Why walking isn't the primary solution:**\n\n*   While walking is great for exercise and the environment, the car still needs to get to the shop.

If you walk, you'd either have to walk back home, get in your car, and drive it to the shop, or walk to the shop, drop off keys, and have someone else move your car (which isn't usually how it works for an oil change).

For an effective oil change, it's generally recommended that the engine oil be warm. Warm oil flows more easily, carries more contaminants in suspension, and drains more completely from the engine. Cold, thick oil will leave more old oil and sludge behind.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Best Course of Action**\n\nYou should **drive your car** to the shop, but with a slight modification to ensure a better oil change.\n\n**Here's the recommended approach:**\n\n1.  **Drive your car for 5-10 minutes *before* heading to the shop.** This could be a quick errand, a loop around the block, or just driving a bit past the shop and coming back. The goal is to get the engine up to operating temperature so the oil is warm.\n2.  **Then, drive the 100 meters to the shop.**\n\n**Why this is the best approach:**\n\n*   **Optimal Oil Change:** Warm oil drains more thoroughly, ensuring more old, dirty oil is removed and replaced with fresh oil.\n*   **Convenience:** Your car is already at the shop, ready for service.\n\nSo, in short: **Drive your car, but make sure it's been driven long enough to warm up the engine first.**", "usage": {"input_tokens": 44, "output_tokens": 493}, "latency_ms": 8212.7, "finish_reason": "FinishReason.STOP"}

You can't just walk over and tell them to change the oil on a car that's still at home.\n\n**Step 2: How to Get the Car to the Shop**\n*   The only practical way to get your car to the shop for service is to drive it there.

While 100 meters is a very short distance and not ideal for a cold engine (it doesn't allow the engine to warm up properly, leading to more wear and emissions over time if done repeatedly), it's a necessary evil for maintenance in this specific scenario.\n\n**Step 4: The Return Trip (You)**\n*   Once you drop off your car for the oil change, you will likely leave it there for some time. This is where walking becomes the practical and sensible choice. Since the shop is only 100 meters away, it will take you less than 2 minutes to walk back home. This saves you the hassle of finding parking, starting your car again, and driving such a short distance.\n\n**Step 5: Picking Up the Car (You)**\n*   When the oil change is complete, you will walk the 100 meters back to the shop to pick up your car.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYou **must drive your car** the 100 meters to the shop to drop it off for the oil change.\n\nHowever, for your personal trips *after dropping off* the car and *to pick it up*, you should **walk** the 100 meters.", "usage": {"input_tokens": 42, "output_tokens": 439}, "latency_ms": 8334.2, "finish_reason": "FinishReason.STOP"}

This entire process will likely take *longer* than walking. Your car will barely have time to warm up.\n    *   **Effort:** More effort involved in the whole driving/parking process than just stepping out the door and walking.\n    *   **Cost:** You'll use a tiny bit of gas, and contribute to wear and tear on your vehicle, however minimal.\n    *   **Environmental Impact:** A cold start and very short drive are less fuel-efficient and produce more emissions per mile than longer trips.\n    *   **Parking:** Even if there's parking, it's an extra step.\n\n3.  **Consider Walking for 100 Meters:**\n    *   **Time:** As calculated, about 1.5 to 2 minutes. You'll likely be there and back before you'd even have your car started and parked.\n    *   **Effort:** Minimal. It's a quick stroll.\n    *   **Cost:** Free!\n    *   **Environmental Impact:** Zero emissions.\n    *   **Health Benefits:** A tiny bit of fresh air and exercise.\n    *   **Convenience:** No need to worry about parking, keys, or traffic.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Exceptions (Why you *might* drive):**\n    *   **Heavy/Bulky Items:** If you plan to buy a case of water, multiple bags of groceries, or something large that would be difficult to carry 100 meters.\n    *   **Weather:** If it's pouring rain, snowing heavily, extremely hot, or freezing cold.\n    *   **Mobility Issues:** If you have a physical condition that makes walking even short distances difficult or painful.\n    *   **Safety Concerns:** If the route, even for 100 meters, is unsafe (e.g., no sidewalk, dangerous intersection, high crime area at night).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnless one of the exceptions above applies to you, you should **definitely walk**.\n\nIt will almost certainly be faster, easier, cheaper, better for the environment, and give you a tiny bit of fresh air.
